🧠 Self-Satisfaction Office

No fixing. Just being heard.

Self-Satisfaction Office is a minimal, therapy-inspired web application designed to provide emotional acknowledgment and validation.
It does not try to solve problems or give advice — instead, it offers a safe space where users can express how they feel and simply be heard.

✨ Why this project?

In many apps and AI tools, the goal is to fix the user’s problem.
But in real life, people often just want validation, not solutions.

This project explores:

Emotional acknowledgment over problem-solving

Boundary-aware conversational design

Human-centric interaction instead of “smart replies”

🧩 Core Idea

The system listens.
It responds with empathy.
It does not instruct, judge, or “optimize” emotions.

🚀 Features

🗣️ Simple conversational interface

💬 Emotion-aware responses (sad, stressed, anxious, happy, etc.)

🧠 No advice, no solutions — only validation

🖥️ Clean and distraction-free UI

🌐 Runs locally using a lightweight backend
